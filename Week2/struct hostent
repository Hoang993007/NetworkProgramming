Data Type: struct hostent

    This data type is used to represent an entry in the hosts database. It has the following members:

    char *h_name
        This is the “official” name of the host.
    
    char **h_aliases
        These are alternative names for the host, represented as a null-terminated vector of strings.
      
    int h_addrtype
        This is the host address type; in practice, its value is always either AF_INET or AF_INET6, with the latter being used for IPv6 hosts. In principle other kinds of addresses could be represented in the database as well as Internet addresses; if this were done, you might find a value in this field other than AF_INET or AF_INET6. See Socket Addresses.

    int h_length
        This is the length, in bytes, of each address.

    char **h_addr_list
        This is the vector of addresses for the host. (Recall that the host might be connected to multiple networks and have different addresses on each one.) The vector is terminated by a null pointer.

    char *h_addr
        This is a synonym for h_addr_list[0]; in other words, it is the first host address.
